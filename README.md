# Wari's Soon-To-Be New Icons for Arcticons
Repo to host my original icon files for Arcticons and other related files.

## Why a separate repo instead of a branch?
The main goal of this repo is to back up the original unoptimized files, not to send things over to the original repo (I use [wwwwwwari/Arcticons](https://github.com/wwwwwwari/Arcticons) for that).

## Licenses
Any SVG files (\*.svg), app filter files (appfilter.xml), and request text files (requests.txt) are under GPL-3.0. If Arcticons' license <https://github.com/Arcticons-Team/Arcticons/blob/main/LICENSE> has changed from GPL-3.0 in the future, the license of the aforementioned SVG, app filter, and request text files shall match the new license instead.

Any other files not cover by the above shall be licensed under The Unlicense perpetually.

Please see the copyright file for more information.
