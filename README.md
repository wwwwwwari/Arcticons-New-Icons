# Wari's Soon-To-Be New Icons for Arcticons
Repo to host my original icon files for Arcticons and other related files.

## Why a separate repo instead of a branch?
The main goal of this repo is to back up the original unoptimized files, not to send things over to the original repo (I use [wwwwwwari/Arcticons](https://github.com/wwwwwwari/Arcticons) for that).

## Licenses
Any files originated from the main Arcticons project use the same license specified by Arcticons. Other files made by me is under Unlicense.
