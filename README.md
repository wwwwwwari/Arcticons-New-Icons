# Wari's Soon-To-Be New Icons for Arcticons
Repo to host my original icon files for Arcticons and other related files.

## Why a separate repo instead of a branch?
The main goal of this repo is to back up the original unoptimized files, not to send things over to the original repo (I use [wwwwwwari/Arcticons](https://github.com/wwwwwwari/Arcticons) for that).

## Licenses
All files originated from the [Arcticons](https://github.com/Donnnno/Arcticons) project ("The Project") in this repository ("The Repository"), whether or not modified, follow the licenses of The Project
- All icons (for example, the .svg files) are under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), following The Project. If The Project changes the license for this type of files in the future, the license for these files in The Repository will also change to match The Project.
- Non-icon files built upon files originally from The Project, including but not limited to `appfilter.xml` and `requests.xml`, are under [GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), following The Project. If The Project changes the license for this type of files in the future, the license for these files in The Repository will also change to match The Project.

All other files not originated from The Project, including but not limited to `checklist.txt`, `random_requests.py`, and `changelog` files are licensed under [The Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/), unless explicitly specified otherwise in The Repository's README.md (this file).
