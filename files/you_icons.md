# About Arcticons You Icons
Things to look out for when making icons because Material You masks can make it ugly.

1. Bubble icons (e.g. Whatsapp) may have their "pointy arrow" touch the border of the circle mask
2. Triangular icons (e.g. Newpipe) may look off-center when applying the circle mask

## Problems
1. I have no clue how Material You works
2. According to here, the "masks" (circle, square, squircle, etc.) that change the icons' shapes are provided by OEM (probably by launchers as well?)
