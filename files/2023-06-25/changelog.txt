*I use the [astrochip](https://monstersuperleague.fandom.com/wiki/Capturing) design for the icon, as it is to this game what pokeball is to pokemon games
**The icon is based on a ["hero"](https://i.imgur.com/JzGv3OM.png) icon from within the game, which is based on one of the main characters. Two other choices are the app's actual [icon](https://i.imgur.com/4jeeM8J.png) and the [text logo](https://i.imgur.com/VFJYBSq.png), both of which I think would be harder to see if made, so I go with the hero icon instead. Any suggestions, let me know.
