This PR includes:
1. 4 new icons for websites (no apps): mangadex, nintendo (+1 alt), tryhackme
2. ? new icons for new apps
3. 3 new apps using existing icons: wetter.com (weather), duet (duet\*), snaptik (downloads)
4. 1 new icon for existing app: antutu benchmark\*\*
5. 2 new generic icons: android_alt_1, power

\*duet already has an icon but is not in the appfilter for some reasons.
\*\*I also removed its entry in appfilter from "citrus" since it's not really the Citrus app
