This PR includes:
1. 4 new icons for websites (no appfilter entries): mangadex, nintendo (+1 alt), tryhackme
2. 5 new apps using existing icons: wetter.com, duet\*, snaptik, cross dj, dailyal
2. 95 new icons for new apps
4. 2 new icons for existing apps: antutu benchmark\*\*, hitv
5. 2 new generic icons: android_alt_1, power

\*duet already has an icon but is not in the appfilter for some reasons.
\*\*I also removed its entry in appfilter from "citrus" since it's not really the Citrus app
